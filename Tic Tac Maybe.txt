stupid opponent code:
randomNumGen RNG is a number between 1-99.
If 1-33, put it on same row (if available)
If 34-66, put it on same column (if available)
If 67-99, put it on same diagonal (if available)
next count how many options are available, and either RNG a 50/50 or place in remaining spot.


Tic tac toe is a two dimensional array, 3x3.
Win condition is three of one symbol in a row, draw is when all spots are full.


Tie all RNG to the computers time.


BanditMaker(int K)
	On initialization creates a list of BanditArm objects equal to K.
	Returns list of k size with each BanditArm

	

List of BanditArm objects

Each BanditArm object when created, uses RNG to populate its rewards and probabilities
	On initialization it generates reward + probability
	Has method, Pull, which uses RNG to find out if a reward is earned
	Has method OptimalReward and OptimalProbability, to give the information about both these characteriztics back to the user.
